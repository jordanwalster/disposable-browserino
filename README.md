## Private Browser
### Electron powered browser. (Abandoned Project)

### Installation

Currently there are no packages to install the browser with. But if you know about node.js, and fancy running it yourself - you are welcome to do so.

### Other Information

#### Vision 
Using the electron project, I'm building a [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) based browser. With the intended purpose of 
tabs being as disposable. Tabs will run completely independently unless specified in Preferences, this means that you could 
have two sessions of a site open without getting logged out of either account because the cookies would be retained in a 
sandbox environment unique to that tab.

#### Design

The design of the browser needed to be something of a reminiscent of browsers that we use today. Rather than taking the 
Microsoft approach of 2012 (Search bar at the bottom... What were they thinking?). 

The design of this browser is heavily inspired by the current versions of Google Chrome. It gives users a familiar approach for
new users of the browser.

There are currently no plans for a bookmarks bar due to the intended use case for the browser - Which ulimately is development.

#### The Looks
